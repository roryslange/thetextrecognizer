# thetextrecognizer

in this one im going to step it up a little. im going to make an mlp since i kinda got the perceptron working but it was super messy and also really boring so this one will hopefully be more interesting and challenging. also this time im going to actually use python instead of torturing myself with trying to relearn c++. new c++ is great and all but here im just gonna learn ml and not any of that boring stuff about pointers.

# What im gonna do

im gonna recognize characters from mnist dataset. yeah the one with the numbers and letters also.

# How im gonna do it

python but not using any of that easy stuff like tensorflow. im doing it with vector math.
